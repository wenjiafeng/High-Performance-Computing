- Somehow, you reported wrong count of prime numbers as below:

The count of prime number shows as 37159.
The wall-clock time is 0.14608.

That is not using the private variable correctly. However, your code also has "private variable" tests.. Not sure how you worked..

From next time, test your code clearly.
